### 2026-03-31 — Phase 0 Complete: CosmosDB Source of Truth + Repository Pattern

**Phase 0 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Freamon + Bunk)
- Storage architecture migrated: CosmosDB is now the durable source of truth; Redis is a write-through cache.
- Repository pattern implemented: `IRepository<T>` abstraction with four concrete repositories (`CosmosPlanRepository`, `CosmosClientRepository`, `CosmosPricingRepository`, `CosmosUsagePolicyRepository`).
- `CachedRepository<T>` wrapper enforces write-through semantics (persist to Cosmos first, then update Redis).
- All endpoints refactored to use repositories instead of direct Redis calls.
- Startup migration and cache warming services in place for backward compatibility and performance.
- **Test Results:** 36 new tests written (B5.1–B5.2), 129/129 tests pass, zero regressions.

**What This Means for Phase 1 Onwards:**
- All future work (routing, pricing, policy enhancements) now builds on stable repositories.
- No more Redis-only data — all configuration data is durable.
- `IRepository<T>` is the extension point for new entities (e.g., `CosmosModelRoutingPolicyRepository` for Phase 1).
- Caching is transparent to callers — endpoint logic unchanged, but storage is now production-safe.

**Files:**
- New: `Repositories/` (5 files), `Services/RedisToCosmossMigrationService.cs`, `Services/CacheWarmingService.cs`, `Services/RepositoryServiceExtensions.cs`
- Refactored: All endpoints + `Program.cs` + `ConfigurationContainerInitializer.cs`
- Tests: 3 new test files (CachedRepositoryTests, RedisToCosmossMigrationServiceTests, CacheWarmingServiceTests)

**Architecture v2 Accepted:**
- Decision 1: CosmosDB is source of truth, Redis is cache (Phase 0 — COMPLETE)
- Decision 2: Per-REQUEST multiplier (not per-token) — Phase 2–3 work
- Decision 3: Foundry deployment discovery (no pattern matching) — Phase 1 work
- Decision 4: Rate limits on routed deployment — Phase 1 work

**Next Phase:** Phase 1 (Model Routing) — Freamon will add `CosmosModelRoutingPolicyRepository` + routing logic at precheck; Bunk will add routing tests.

### 2026-03-31 — Full Code Review: Phases 0–4 (All Feature Work)

**Verdict:** CONDITIONALLY APPROVED — 3 blocking, 8 should-fix, 5 nice-to-have.

**Blocking Issues Found:**
1. **Precheck does NOT enforce `MonthlyRequestQuota`** for multiplier billing plans. Only `MonthlyTokenQuota` is checked. Plans with `UseMultiplierBilling = true` have zero quota enforcement at the APIM gate. Fix: add request quota check in `PrecheckEndpoints.cs`.
2. **Frontend `RequestSummaryResponse.billingPeriod`** type is `{ year, month }` but backend returns string `"YYYY-MM"`. Will crash `RequestBilling.tsx` at runtime.
3. **Frontend `RouteRule`** missing `priority` and `enabled` fields. Users cannot set rule priority or disable rules from the UI.

**Key Should-Fix Items:**
- Dead code in `Repositories/` directory (duplicates `Services/` with different behavior) — must delete.
- APIM outbound log body uses string interpolation for JSON — injection risk on claims with quotes.
- `ConfigurationContainerProvider.EnsureInitializedAsync` has a race condition (volatile bool insufficient).
- `LogIngestEndpoints` never persists `RoutingPolicyId` — audit trail gap.
- Frontend TypeScript types don't include multiplier billing fields on base types; relies on `Extended` interfaces and runtime type coercion.
- `ChargebackCalculator` pricing cache is not thread-safe.
- Frontend API error handling discards backend error payloads.

**What's Solid:**
- Repository pattern and write-through cache semantics are correct.
- `RoutingEvaluator` is pure, stateless, and well-tested (priority, enabled, deny, passthrough, fallback).
- Multiplier billing math (`effective_cost = 1 × multiplier`) is correct.
- Authorization model applied consistently.
- 200 tests passing with strong critical-path coverage.
- APIM routing integration (precheck → rewrite URI → deployment-scoped rate limits) works correctly.
- Backward compatibility maintained via nullable fields with defaults.

### 2026-03-31 — Deep Architecture Exploration + Feature Design

**Codebase Architecture:**
- Backend uses **Minimal APIs** (no MVC controllers) — all endpoints in `Endpoints/` directory
- Redis is the **primary runtime store** for plans, clients, pricing, logs, traces, rate limits, usage policy
- CosmosDB stores **audit logs** (`audit-logs` container) and **billing summaries** (`billing-summaries` container), partitioned by `/customerKey`
- `ChargebackCalculator` uses an **in-memory pricing cache** refreshed every 30s from Redis — non-blocking on the request path
- **Precheck endpoint** is the APIM enforcement choke point — checks assignment, plan, quota, rate limits, deployment access
- APIM policies call precheck **inbound**, then log usage **outbound** (fire-and-forget POST to `/api/log`)
- Frontend is **tab-based** (no react-router), state-driven in `App.tsx`, polling for live data (5s/10s intervals)
- Auth: AzureAd JWT bearer with three policies: `ExportPolicy`, `ApimPolicy`, `AdminPolicy`

**Key Extension Points:**
- `PlanData.AllowedDeployments` / `ClientPlanAssignment.AllowedDeployments` — existing deployment access control
- `ModelPricing` in Redis (`pricing:{modelId}`) — already per-model, extend with multiplier/tier
- `PrecheckEndpoints.cs` — routing decisions go here (add `routedDeployment` to response)
- `ChargebackCalculator` — cost calculation, extend with `CalculateBillingUnits()`
- `AuditLogDocument` / `BillingSummaryDocument` — extend with routing + multiplier fields (additive, nullable)
- `RedisKeys.cs` — centralized key patterns, add `routing-policy:{policyId}`

**Architecture Decisions Made:**
- Model Routing: new `ModelRoutingPolicy` entity, Redis-backed, attached to plans via `ModelRoutingPolicyId`
- Multiplier Pricing: extend `ModelPricing` with `Multiplier` + `TierName`, extend `PlanData` with unit quotas
- Both features converge at precheck — routing decides *where*, pricing decides *how much*
- All changes are additive/backward-compatible — `UseMultiplierBilling` flag for gradual migration
- No new storage systems — Redis for runtime config, CosmosDB for audit (existing containers)
- Proposal written to `.squad/decisions/inbox/mcnulty-model-routing-pricing-architecture.md`
- Revised proposal (v2) written to `.squad/decisions/inbox/mcnulty-architecture-v2.md`

### 2026-03-31 — Four Design Decisions (from Zack Way) & Architecture v2

**Decision 1: CosmosDB is Source of Truth, Redis is Cache Only**
- All configuration data (plans, clients, pricing, routing policies, usage policy) MUST persist to CosmosDB. Redis is ONLY a write-through cache.
- Architectural implication: New repository pattern (`IRepository<T>` → Cosmos persistence → `CachedRepository<T>` Redis wrapper). New `configuration` Cosmos container. One-time migration service (Redis → Cosmos on startup). Cache warming service. All endpoint refactoring to use repositories instead of direct Redis calls.
- This is the largest body of work (Phase 0) and must complete before feature work.

**Decision 2: Per-REQUEST Multiplier (not per-token)**
- `effective_cost = 1 × model_multiplier` per request. GPT-4.1 = 1.0x, GPT-4.1-mini = 0.33x.
- Architectural implication: Simpler calculator logic — no token division. `MonthlyRequestQuota` replaces `MonthlyUnitQuota`. `CurrentPeriodRequests` replaces `CurrentPeriodUnits`. All "unit" terminology changed to "effective requests".

**Decision 3: Foundry Deployment Discovery (no pattern matching)**
- Routing maps to specific known deployments from Foundry. No globs, no regex.
- Architectural implication: `RouteRule.RequestedDeployment` is exact match only. All `RoutedDeployment` values validated against `IDeploymentDiscoveryService.GetDeploymentsAsync()` on create/update. Existing `DeploymentDiscoveryService` is the integration point.

**Decision 4: Rate Limits on Routed Deployment**
- RPM/TPM limits apply to the routed deployment (what hits the backend), not the requested model.
- Architectural implication: Rate limit Redis keys include deployment ID. New key pattern: `ratelimit:rpm:{client}:{tenant}:{deploymentId}:{window}`. Precheck evaluates rate limits AFTER routing resolution.

**File Paths:**
- Models: `src/Chargeback.Api/Models/` (PlanData.cs, ClientPlanAssignment.cs, ModelPricing.cs, AuditLogDocument.cs, BillingSummaryDocument.cs)
- Endpoints: `src/Chargeback.Api/Endpoints/` (PrecheckEndpoints.cs, PricingEndpoints.cs, PlanEndpoints.cs, etc.)
- Services: `src/Chargeback.Api/Services/` (ChargebackCalculator.cs, RedisKeys.cs, AuditStore.cs, AuditLogWriter.cs)
- APIM Policies: `policies/subscription-key-policy.xml`, `policies/entra-jwt-policy.xml`
- Frontend types: `src/chargeback-ui/src/types.ts`
- Frontend API client: `src/chargeback-ui/src/api.ts`
- Aspire orchestration: `src/Chargeback.AppHost/AppHost.cs`

### 2026-03-31 — Code Review Complete: All 11 Findings Fixed (APPROVED)

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

- Frontend: tsc clean, vite build clean, 0 new linting issues
- No architectural changes — all fixes are bug corrections + code cleanup

**Production Readiness:** APPROVED FOR MERGE
- Security: JSON injection fixed, audit trail complete, cache thread-safe
- Reliability: Precheck enforces quotas, race conditions eliminated
- Code Quality: Dead code removed, type safety improved, error messages actionable
- Backward Compatibility: Maintained (all new fields nullable with defaults)

**Next Phase:** Deploy backend + frontend together. Schedule N1–N5 optimizations for future sprint.

**Decision:** Merged review findings into `.squad/decisions.md`. Ready for production deployment.

### 2026-03-31 — Re-Review Complete: All 11 Findings Verified ✅

**Status:** APPROVED — independent verification of all 11 fixes.

McNulty re-reviewed every file touched by Freamon (6 backend) and Kima (5 frontend). All fixes are correctly implemented, no regressions, no new issues introduced.

**Key Verification Points:**
- B1: Multiplier request quota enforcement is in the right place in PrecheckEndpoints.cs (after token check, before rate limits). Returns 429 with correct field names.
- B2: `billingPeriod` is `string` in types.ts. RequestBilling.tsx renders it as-is — no `.year`/`.month` access.
- B3: `RouteRule` has `priority: number` + `enabled: boolean`. RoutingPolicies.tsx form has both editable priority input and enabled toggle.
- S1: `Repositories/` directory confirmed deleted. Zero namespace references remain.
- S2: Both APIM policies use `JObject` construction — zero string interpolation in outbound log body.
- S3: `SemaphoreSlim(1,1)` with proper double-check locking. No `volatile bool`.
- S4: `routingPolicyId` flows end-to-end: precheck response → APIM capture → log payload → `LogIngestRequest` → `AuditLogItem` → `AuditLogDocument`.
- S5: `ModelPricing` has `multiplier` + `tierName` on the base type. No `ModelPricingExtended` band-aid.
- S6: `PlanCreateRequest` and `PlanUpdateRequest` both include all 4 multiplier billing fields.
- S7: `lock(_cacheLock)` with double-check pattern. Timestamp set inside lock, Redis read outside. No bare access.
- S8: `parseErrorMessage` helper applied consistently to all 27 API functions.

**Verdict:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/mcnulty-rereview-verdict.md`
