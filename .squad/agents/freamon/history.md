## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

### Phase 0 — Storage Migration (2026-03-31)

**What was done:** Implemented full Phase 0 from architecture-v2. CosmosDB is now source of truth for all configuration data (plans, clients, pricing, usage policy). Redis is cache-only with write-through pattern.

**Key files created:**
- `Services/IRepository.cs` — generic repository interface (`IRepository<T>`)
- `Services/CosmosRepositoryBase.cs` — shared Cosmos CRUD base class
- `Services/CosmosPlanRepository.cs`, `CosmosClientRepository.cs`, `CosmosPricingRepository.cs`, `CosmosUsagePolicyRepository.cs` — concrete Cosmos repos
- `Services/CachedRepository.cs` — write-through Redis cache decorator
- `Services/ConfigurationContainerProvider.cs` — Cosmos "configuration" container initialization
- `Services/RedisToCosmossMigrationService.cs` — Redis→Cosmos data migration (IHostedService)
- `Services/CacheWarmingService.cs` — Cosmos→Redis cache warming (IHostedService)

**Key files modified:**
- `Models/PlanData.cs`, `ClientPlanAssignment.cs`, `ModelPricing.cs`, `UsagePolicySettings.cs` — added `Id` and `PartitionKey` for Cosmos
- `Services/IUsagePolicyStore.cs` + `UsagePolicyStore.cs` — refactored to use `IRepository<UsagePolicySettings>` internally
- `Services/LogDataService.cs` — updated for new `IUsagePolicyStore` interface
- `Program.cs` — full DI wiring: Cosmos repos → CachedRepository wrappers → hosted services
- All 6 endpoint files refactored to use `IRepository<T>` instead of direct Redis

**Patterns established:**
- Single Cosmos container "configuration" with partition key `/partitionKey` for all config entities
- Partition values: "plan", "client", "pricing", "settings"
- Write path: endpoint → `IRepository<T>` → `CachedRepository.UpsertAsync` → Cosmos first → Redis cache
- Read path: endpoint → `IRepository<T>` → `CachedRepository.GetAsync` → Redis first → Cosmos fallback
- Startup order: `RedisToCosmossMigrationService` → `CacheWarmingService` → app ready
- Ephemeral data (rate limits, logs, traces, locks) stays Redis-only
- Test fixture uses `RedisBackedRepository<T>` to preserve FakeRedis seeding patterns

**Decisions:**
- `GetAllAsync` always queries Cosmos (source of truth for listings), not Redis scan
- Repository classes made `public` (not internal) for test fixture accessibility
- Corrupted Redis data returns null from repository (treated as "not found"), not 500

### Phase 1 — Foundation: New Models + CRUD (2026-03-31)

**What was done:** Implemented all 10 work items (F1.1–F1.10) for Phase 1. Added routing policy entity with full CRUD, extended existing models with multiplier billing and request-based quota fields, and wired everything into the repository/DI/cache-warming pipeline.

**Key files created:**
- `Models/ModelRoutingPolicy.cs` — routing policy entity (Id, Name, Rules, DefaultBehavior, FallbackDeployment)
- `Models/RouteRule.cs` — individual route rule (RequestedDeployment → RoutedDeployment, Priority, Enabled)
- `Models/RoutingBehavior.cs` — enum (Passthrough, Deny)
- `Services/CosmosRoutingPolicyRepository.cs` — Cosmos persistence, partition key "routing-policy"
- `Endpoints/RoutingPolicyEndpoints.cs` — full CRUD with deployment validation against DeploymentDiscoveryService

**Key files modified:**
- `Models/ModelPricing.cs` — added Multiplier (decimal, default 1.0m), TierName (string, default "Standard")
- `Models/PlanData.cs` — added ModelRoutingPolicyId, MonthlyRequestQuota, OverageRatePerRequest, UseMultiplierBilling
- `Models/ClientPlanAssignment.cs` — added ModelRoutingPolicyOverride, CurrentPeriodRequests, OverbilledRequests, RequestsByTier
- `Models/ClientUsageResponse.cs` — added request usage fields + RequestUtilizationPercent
- `Models/PlanCreateRequest.cs`, `PlanUpdateRequest.cs` — added new plan fields to DTOs
- `Models/ModelPricingCreateRequest.cs` — added Multiplier, TierName
- `Services/RedisKeys.cs` — added RoutingPolicy key, RoutingPolicyPrefix, deployment-scoped rate limit keys
- `Services/CacheWarmingService.cs` — warms routing policy cache on startup
- `Services/RoutingPolicyValidator.cs` — fixed property name (TargetDeployment → RoutedDeployment)
- `Endpoints/PricingEndpoints.cs` — updated seed data with multiplier/tier values, upsert handler passes through new fields
- `Endpoints/PlanEndpoints.cs` — create/update wire new fields, billing period reset includes request counters
- `Endpoints/ClientDetailEndpoints.cs` — response includes request usage data + utilization %
- `Program.cs` — DI registration for CosmosRoutingPolicyRepository + CachedRepository<ModelRoutingPolicy>, endpoint mapping

**Patterns followed:**
- Same repository pattern as Phase 0: CosmosRoutingPolicyRepository → CachedRepository<ModelRoutingPolicy> wrapper
- Partition key "routing-policy" in shared "configuration" container
- All new fields have safe defaults (0, false, null, empty) — existing data won't break
- Routing policy delete returns 409 if policy is referenced by any plan or client assignment
- Deployment validation skipped when discovery returns empty (service may be unconfigured)
- Seed pricing multipliers: GPT-4.1=1.0x Standard, GPT-4.1-mini=0.33x Standard, GPT-5.2=3.0x Premium

**Test results:** 129/129 tests pass, 0 regressions

### Phase 1 — Model Routing + Per-Request Multiplier Pricing (2026-03-31)

**What was done:** Implemented all 10 work items (F1.1–F1.10) for Phase 1. Added routing policy entity with full CRUD endpoints, extended models with multiplier billing and request-based quota, and integrated with repository/DI/cache-warming.

**Key files created:**
- `Models/ModelRoutingPolicy.cs` — routing policy with rules and behaviors
- `Models/RouteRule.cs`, `RoutingBehavior.cs` — routing rule and behavior types
- `Repositories/CosmosRoutingPolicyRepository.cs` — Cosmos persistence
- `Endpoints/RoutingPolicyEndpoints.cs` — GET/POST/PUT/DELETE with validation

**Key files extended:**
- `Models/ModelPricing.cs` — Multiplier (default 1.0m), TierName
- `Models/PlanData.cs` — ModelRoutingPolicyId, MonthlyRequestQuota, UseMultiplierBilling
- `Models/ClientPlanAssignment.cs` — ModelRoutingPolicyOverride, request usage tracking
- `Services/CacheWarmingService.cs` — routing policy cache warmup
- `Program.cs` — DI registration for routing repository

**Patterns established:**
- Routing uses exact Foundry deployment matching (no glob/regex)
- Three routing modes: per-account, enforced, QoS-based (via DefaultBehavior + rules)
- Multiplier pricing: cost = 1 × model_multiplier (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini = 0.33x baseline)
- All new fields have safe defaults (backward compatible)
- Routing policy delete enforces referential integrity
- Deployment validation against DeploymentDiscoveryService with graceful degradation

**Test results:** 129/129 tests maintained, awaiting Bunk Phase 1 test pass

### Phase 2 — Enforcement: Precheck + Calculator + Log Ingest (2026-03-31)

**What was done:** Implemented all 7 work items (F2.1–F2.7). Routing evaluation in the precheck hot path, deployment-scoped rate limits, multiplier billing in log ingest, extended audit/billing documents, and two new export endpoints.

**Key files created:**
- `Models/RequestSummaryResponse.cs` — response DTOs for request-summary endpoint
- `Endpoints/RequestBillingEndpoints.cs` — GET /api/chargeback/request-summary + GET /api/export/request-billing

**Key files modified:**
- `Endpoints/PrecheckEndpoints.cs` — routing evaluation via RoutingEvaluator, in-memory policy cache (30s TTL), deployment-scoped rate limit keys, AllowedDeployments check on routed deployment, enriched response with routedDeployment/requestedDeployment/routingPolicyId
- `Endpoints/LogIngestEndpoints.cs` — multiplier billing (effectiveRequestCost, tier tracking, overage), request counter updates on ClientPlanAssignment, billing period reset includes request counters, routing metadata in audit items
- `Services/ChargebackCalculator.cs` — added GetTierName() and GetMultiplier() public methods
- `Services/IChargebackCalculator.cs` — interface extended with GetTierName and GetMultiplier
- `Models/AuditLogDocument.cs` — added RequestedDeploymentId, RoutingPolicyId, Multiplier, EffectiveRequestCost, TierName (all nullable)
- `Models/BillingSummaryDocument.cs` — added TotalEffectiveRequests, EffectiveRequestsByTier, MultiplierOverageCost (all nullable)
- `Models/AuditLogItem.cs` — added routing/multiplier fields for channel transport
- `Services/AuditLogWriter.cs` — passes through new fields to AuditLogDocument
- `Services/AuditStore.cs` — accumulates multiplier billing fields in billing summary upserts
- `Program.cs` — maps RequestBillingEndpoints

**Test factory updated:**
- `ChargebackApiFactory.cs` — registers IRepository<ModelRoutingPolicy> with RedisBackedRepository

**Patterns followed:**
- PrecheckEndpoints uses ConcurrentDictionary in-memory cache for routing policies (30s refresh), not Redis per-request
- RoutingEvaluator is pure static logic — adopted Bunk's existing implementation unchanged
- Rate limit keys use deployment-scoped overload when deployment is available, fall back to legacy keys for backward compat
- All new AuditLogDocument/BillingSummaryDocument fields are nullable — existing data stays valid
- Multiplier billing only activates when plan.UseMultiplierBilling is true
- Routing policy resolution: ClientPlanAssignment.ModelRoutingPolicyOverride ?? PlanData.ModelRoutingPolicyId
- AllowedDeployments check runs on the ROUTED deployment, not the originally requested one

**Test results:** 200/200 tests pass, 0 regressions

### Code Review Fixes — McNulty's 6 Findings (2026-03-31)

**What was done:** Implemented 6 fixes from McNulty's code review (B1, S1, S2, S3, S4, S7).

**B1 — Precheck multiplier request quota:**
- `Endpoints/PrecheckEndpoints.cs` — Added multiplier request quota check after existing token quota logic. Returns 429 when `effectiveRequests >= plan.MonthlyRequestQuota` and `!plan.AllowOverbilling`. Only activates when `plan.UseMultiplierBilling` and `plan.MonthlyRequestQuota > 0`.

**S1 — Deleted dead Repositories/ directory:**
- Removed `src/Chargeback.Api/Repositories/` (4 files: `CachedRepository.cs`, `CacheWarmingService.cs`, `IRepository.cs`, `RedisToCosmossMigrationService.cs`). All active code lives in `Services/`.
- Updated test files (`CachedRepositoryTests.cs`, `CosmosPersistenceResilienceTests.cs`) to reference `Chargeback.Api.Services` namespace with corrected constructor params (`redisKeyFromId`/`entityId` instead of `keySelector`/`redisKey`).
- Removed `CacheWarmingServiceTests.cs` and `RedisToCosmossMigrationServiceTests.cs` (tested deleted `ICacheWarmable`/`IMigratable` interfaces).
- Removed 4 integration tests from `CosmosPersistenceResilienceTests` that tested deleted interface-based migration/warming services.

**S2 — APIM JSON injection fix:**
- `policies/entra-jwt-policy.xml`, `policies/subscription-key-policy.xml` — Replaced string interpolation (`$"{{\"tenantId\": \"{tenantId}\"..."`) with `JObject` construction in outbound log body. Eliminates JSON injection from JWT claims or subscription names.

**S3 — ConfigurationContainerProvider race condition:**
- `Services/ConfigurationContainerProvider.cs` — Replaced `volatile bool _initialized` with `SemaphoreSlim(1,1)` double-check locking. Safe under concurrent `EnsureInitializedAsync` calls.

**S4 — Persist RoutingPolicyId in audit trail:**
- Both APIM policy files — Added `routingPolicyId` extraction from precheck response in inbound section. Included in outbound JObject log payload.
- `Models/LogIngestRequest.cs` — Added `RoutingPolicyId` property.
- `Endpoints/LogIngestEndpoints.cs` — Passes `ingestRequest.RoutingPolicyId` to `AuditLogItem` instead of hardcoded `null`.

**S7 — ChargebackCalculator pricing cache thread safety:**
- `Services/ChargebackCalculator.cs` — Added `_cacheLock` object. Double-check locking pattern: outer check without lock, inner check-and-set of `_lastCacheRefresh` inside lock, actual Redis read outside lock (async-safe). Prevents stampede while keeping I/O non-blocking.

**Test results:** 198/198 tests pass, 0 regressions (net -22 from deleted Repositories tests that tested dead code)

### Codebase Review Fixes — 4 Validated Findings (2026-04-01)

**What was done:** Implemented 4 fixes from codebase review (#1, #2, #11, #15).

**#1 — Audit record duplication on retry (CRITICAL):**
- `Services/AuditLogWriter.cs` — Replaced random `Guid.NewGuid()` IDs with deterministic SHA256-based IDs derived from `clientAppId|tenantId|deploymentId|timestamp|totalTokens|promptTokens`. Documents are built once before the retry loop with stable IDs, so retries are idempotent.
- `Services/AuditStore.cs` — Changed `WriteBatchAsync` from `CreateItemAsync` to `UpsertItemAsync`, ensuring partial-success retries don't fail with 409 Conflict on already-written documents.

**#2 — Billing summary race condition (CRITICAL):**
- `Services/AuditStore.cs` — `UpsertBillingSummariesAsync` now uses Cosmos optimistic concurrency with ETags. Reads capture the ETag, writes pass `IfMatchEtag`. On 412 (Precondition Failed), re-reads and retries up to 5 times. Prevents concurrent batches from silently overwriting each other's usage accumulations.

**#11 — AuditStore initialization race condition (IMPORTANT):**
- `Services/AuditStore.cs` — Replaced `volatile bool _initialized` with `SemaphoreSlim(1,1)` double-check locking pattern, matching the fix already applied to `ConfigurationContainerProvider`. Prevents duplicate container creation calls under concurrent initialization.

**#15 — LogIngest lock released before Cosmos write (IMPORTANT):**
- `Endpoints/LogIngestEndpoints.cs` — Increased Redis lock TTL from 5s to 30s to prevent lock auto-expiry during the read-compute-write cycle. Added `LockExtendAsync` call immediately before `clientRepo.UpsertAsync` to refresh the TTL, ensuring the lock cannot expire during Cosmos I/O even if earlier operations were slow.

**Patterns applied:**
- Deterministic document IDs (SHA256 hash of identity fields) for natural idempotency
- ETag-based optimistic concurrency with read-modify-write retry loop for Cosmos upserts
- SemaphoreSlim double-check locking for async initialization (consistent with ConfigurationContainerProvider)
- Redis lock TTL extension before slow I/O operations to prevent silent lock expiry

**Test results:** 198/198 tests pass, 0 regressions
