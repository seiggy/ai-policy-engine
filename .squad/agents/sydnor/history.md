## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

### 2026-03-31 — Phase 0 Complete: Backend Storage Architecture Established

**Phase 0 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Freamon + Bunk)

The backend storage architecture has been refactored from Redis-only to a durable CosmosDB source-of-truth pattern with Redis as a write-through cache. Infrastructure implications:

**What Sydnor Needs to Know:**
- **New CosmosDB Container:** `configuration` container added to `ConfigurationContainerInitializer`. Stores plans, clients, pricing, usage policies, and future routing policies. Partitioned by `/id` (document ID).
- **Redis Remains Caching Layer:** All reads still go through Redis first. Write-through cache means writes hit Cosmos first, then Redis is updated.
- **Startup Services:** New services on startup: `RedisToCosmossMigrationService` (one-time migration of existing Redis data) and `CacheWarmingService` (populate Redis from Cosmos). Both are idempotent.
- **No New Azure Resources:** Existing Cosmos + Redis still sufficient. No changes to Bicep or Azure resource provisioning needed.
- **Container Initialization:** `ConfigurationContainerInitializer.cs` now creates `configuration` container with proper schema initialization.
- **Deployment Impact:** Minimal. Startup is slightly slower due to cache warming, but no downtime required. Redis data is automatically migrated on first startup.

**For Phase 1 Onwards:**
- Model Routing will add `routing-policies` to the `configuration` container.
- Multiplier Pricing will extend existing `pricing` and `plans` documents with new fields.
- All future configuration entities will use the same repository pattern + caching layer.

**Test Results:** 129/129 tests pass (36 new Phase 5 tests for repositories/migration/warmup).

### 2026-03-31 — Phase 1 Complete: Model Routing Architecture Ready for Phase 3

**Phase 1 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Freamon + Bunk)

All model routing and per-request multiplier pricing features are complete and tested. Backend API contracts finalized. Infrastructure requirements unchanged (uses existing CosmosDB + Redis).

**What Sydnor Needs to Know for Phase 3:**

- **Backend is Ready:** All 7 routing enforcement endpoints ready (F2.1–F2.7). No more breaking changes — API contracts stable.
- **Precheck Response Extended:** New fields available: `routedDeployment`, `requestedDeployment`, `routingPolicyId`. APIM policies can use these for access control decisions.
- **Rate Limiting by Deployment:** Rate limit checks now deployment-scoped. The routed deployment is the one that gets rate-limited, not the originally requested model.
- **Multiplier Billing Fields:** Audit trail includes pricing data: `Multiplier`, `EffectiveRequestCost`, `TierName`. APIM policies can log these for chargeback.
- **Deployment Discovery:** All routing evaluations validate against Foundry deployments. Empty Foundry = strict validation failure (no phantom references).
- **No New Azure Resources:** Phase 3 uses existing resources. APIM policies are stateless — they call precheck and log ingest endpoints.
- **Backward Compat:** All new fields are nullable. Existing clients continue to work without changes.

**Ready for Phase 3 Deployment:**
- Deploy Chargeback.Api with Phase 2 enforcement active
- Configure APIM policies to call precheck endpoint for authentication/authorization
- APIM policies log routing + pricing metadata via log ingest endpoint
- No schema migrations needed — CosmosDB containers already configured

**Test Results:** 200/200 tests pass (30 new Phase 2 integration tests from Bunk B5.7 + B5.8).

### 2026-03-31 — Phase 3 Complete: APIM Auto-Router Policies (S3.1–S3.3)

**Phase 3 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Sydnor)

Both APIM policy files updated with auto-router support. Identical routing logic in both policies.

**What Changed:**

- **Inbound — Auto-Router Logic (after precheck, before backend):**
  - Extracts `routedDeployment` from precheck 200 response using `Body.As<JObject>(preserveContent: true)`
  - If `routedDeployment` is non-empty AND differs from the client's `deploymentId`: saves original as `originalDeploymentId`, updates `deploymentId`, rewrites URL path via `<rewrite-uri>`
  - If `routedDeployment` is null/empty or matches requested deployment: no-op, existing behavior preserved
  - Comment block explains auto-router semantics: no forced downgrades, pass-through for explicit deployments

- **Outbound — Extended Log Payload:**
  - Added `requestedDeploymentId` (original client ask) and `routedDeployment` (precheck recommendation) to the fire-and-forget `/api/log` POST
  - `requestedDeploymentId` = `originalDeploymentId` if routing happened, else `deploymentId`
  - `routedDeployment` = precheck value or empty string

**Design Decisions:**
- `preserveContent: true` on response body read ensures the body stream isn't consumed before backend routing
- `&amp;&amp;` used in XML condition (proper XML entity encoding for `&&`)
- URL rewrite uses `path.Replace()` — safe no-op when URL doesn't contain `/deployments/{id}/` (e.g., Responses API body-based model)
- `originalDeploymentId` only set inside routing `<when>` block — log payload checks `ContainsKey` to handle both routed and non-routed paths

**Files Modified:**
- `policies/subscription-key-policy.xml` — +43 lines (S3.1 + S3.3)
- `policies/entra-jwt-policy.xml` — +43 lines (S3.2 + S3.3)

### 2026-03-31 — Session Complete: All 5 Phases Delivered

### 2026-04-01 — Infrastructure Hardening: 5 Validated Findings Fixed

**Findings Fixed:** #6, #8, #9, #10, #17

**#6 — APIM Least-Privilege Roles (CRITICAL):**
- **Removed** Contributor role assignment on entire RG for APIM — over-privileged and unnecessary.
- **Fixed wrong GUID**: Key Vault Secrets User assignment was using `7f951dda` (AcrPull!) instead of `4633458b` (Key Vault Secrets User). Bug in original Bicep.
- **Upgraded** OpenAI role from `Cognitive Services User` to `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` — narrower scope, least-privilege.
- APIM now has exactly 2 roles: Key Vault Secrets User + Cognitive Services OpenAI User.
- APIM→Container App calls use Entra ID token acquisition, not Azure RBAC — no role needed.

**#8 — Cosmos Keys Disabled (CRITICAL):**
- Set `disableLocalAuth: true` on Cosmos account. Managed identity only (DefaultAzureCredential already in use).
- Connection strings with keys can no longer authenticate. All access via Entra ID.

**#9 — ACR Managed Identity Pull (CRITICAL):**
- Replaced admin username/password ACR pull with `identity: 'system'` on Container App registry config.
- Removed `acrUsername` and `acrPassword` params from Bicep + deployment scripts.
- Added `acrName` param + conditional AcrPull role assignment for Container App managed identity.
- Updated `parameter.json`, `parameter.sample.json`, `setup-azure.ps1`, `setup-azure.sh`.

**#10 — Health Checks Unconditional (IMPORTANT):**
- Removed `if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())` gate from `MapDefaultEndpoints()` in ServiceDefaults.
- Health endpoints `/health` and `/alive` now always registered with `.AllowAnonymous()`.
- Required for container orchestration liveness/readiness probes in production.

**#17 — Streaming Parser Hardened (IMPORTANT):**
- Changed chunk filter from `l.Contains("{")` to `l.Contains("\"usage\"")` in both APIM policies.
- Now only parses SSE chunks that contain the `"usage"` field, not arbitrary JSON (error responses, etc.).
- Applied identically to `subscription-key-policy.xml` and `entra-jwt-policy.xml`.

**Verification:** 198/198 tests pass. Build clean. Zero regressions.

**Key Learnings:**
- The original Key Vault role assignment for APIM was silently using the AcrPull GUID (`7f951dda`). Always cross-check role GUIDs against `roles.json` — don't trust inline comments.
- `Cognitive Services User` is broader than `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` — for APIM calling only OpenAI, the narrower role suffices.
- Container Apps support `identity: 'system'` in registry config — no need for admin creds or secretRef.
- Aspire ServiceDefaults template gates health checks behind `IsDevelopment()` by default — must override for production container deployments.

### 2026-04-01 — AADSTS50011 Redirect URI Mismatch Fixed

**Bug:** After Bicep deployment, the React SPA failed to authenticate — Entra ID returned `AADSTS50011` because the redirect URI didn't match any configured URIs on the app registration.

**Root Cause (two issues):**

1. **Wrong app registration (PowerShell only):** `setup-azure.ps1` Phase 8 set SPA redirect URIs on `$client1ObjId` (Chargeback Sample Client) but NOT on `$apiObjId` (Chargeback API). The frontend's MSAL config uses the API app's client ID (`VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=$apiAppId`), so the redirect must be on the API app. The bash version (`setup-azure.sh`) already correctly targeted both apps — the PowerShell script was missing the API app.

2. **Trailing slash mismatch (both scripts):** Both `setup-azure.ps1` and `setup-azure.sh` registered URIs with trailing slashes (`https://host/`) but the MSAL SPA sends `window.location.origin` which returns `https://host` without a trailing slash. Entra ID performs exact matching on SPA redirect URIs.

**Fix:**
- `setup-azure.ps1` Phase 8: Added API app redirect URI configuration (Graph PATCH on `$apiObjId`) before the client app 1 configuration. Removed trailing slashes.
- `setup-azure.sh` Phase 8: Removed trailing slashes from redirect URIs.
- `deploy-container.ps1`: Already correct — no changes needed (targets API app, no trailing slashes).

**Key Learnings:**
- MSAL SPA `redirectUri: window.location.origin` always returns URLs without trailing slashes. Entra ID SPA redirect URI matching is exact — `https://host/` ≠ `https://host`.
- When the frontend uses `VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID` = API app ID, the SPA redirect URI must be registered on that API app registration, not just on client apps.
- Always cross-check PowerShell and bash versions of deployment scripts — they can drift independently.

### 2026-04-01 — DLP Policy Variants: Content-Check Optional Enforcement

**Task:** Created 2 DLP-enabled APIM policy variants to support Purview DLP content blocking.

**Background:**
- New endpoint available: `POST /api/content-check/{clientAppId}/{tenantId}` performs Purview DLP blocking.
- Not all customers need DLP — most just need precheck auth/authorization.
- Zack's directive: offer 2 policy variants per auth type (with and without content-check).

**Files Created:**
- `policies/subscription-key-policy-dlp.xml` — Subscription key auth + DLP content-check
- `policies/entra-jwt-policy-dlp.xml` — Entra JWT auth + DLP content-check

**How DLP Variants Work:**
1. **After precheck succeeds (200)** and **before backend forwarding**, the DLP variant calls:
   ```
   POST /api/content-check/{clientAppId}/{tenantId}
   ```
2. The content-check receives the same `requestBody` that was captured at the top of the inbound section.
3. **If HTTP 451 returned:** Request is blocked with an Azure OpenAI-style content_filter error response.
4. **If any other status or failure:** Request proceeds (fail-open strategy via `ignore-error="true"`).
5. **Timeout:** 10 seconds, same as precheck.

**Fail-Open Strategy:**
- Uses `ignore-error="true"` on the `send-request` element.
- Transient content-check failures (timeouts, 500s, network issues) DON'T block valid requests.
- Only explicit HTTP 451 response blocks the request.

**Error Response Format:**
- HTTP 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons)
- JSON body mimics Azure OpenAI content filter error:
  ```json
  {
    "error": {
      "message": "Content blocked by policy",
      "type": "content_filter",
      "code": "content_blocked"
    }
  }
  ```

**Base Policies Unchanged:**
- `policies/subscription-key-policy.xml` — No content-check, precheck only (baseline)
- `policies/entra-jwt-policy.xml` — No content-check, precheck only (baseline)

**DLP Variants Header Comment:**
```xml
<!-- DLP-ENABLED VARIANT: Includes Purview DLP content-check before forwarding to OpenAI.
     Use this policy for tenants/products that require DLP policy enforcement.
     For tenants without DLP, use the base policy (without -dlp suffix). -->
```

**Outbound Section:**
- Both base and DLP policies already have the log-ingest fire-and-forget call in the outbound section.
- No changes needed — logging is identical for both variants.

**Policy Selection Guide:**
- **Use base policies** (no `-dlp` suffix) for customers WITHOUT DLP requirements → faster, simpler
- **Use DLP policies** (`-dlp` suffix) for customers WITH Purview DLP policies → adds content-check gate

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Placement:** Content-check occurs after routing but before backend call, so routed deployment is already determined.
- **Variable Reuse:** Uses existing `requestBody`, `containerAppBaseUrl`, `msi-access-token`, `clientAppId`, `tenantId` variables.
- **No New Variables:** Content-check response is stored in `contentCheckResponse` variable, checked only for HTTP 451.
- **C# Expression Safety:** Uses `context.Variables.ContainsKey("contentCheckResponse")` null-check before accessing response.
- **XML Entity Encoding:** `&amp;&amp;` for `&&` in condition expressions (proper XML syntax).

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing deployments using base policies continue unchanged.
- DLP variants are opt-in — customers explicitly choose the DLP policy when they need content enforcement.

**Next Steps:**
- Deploy DLP policies to APIM for customers requiring Purview DLP.
- Document policy selection criteria in deployment guides.
- Test fail-open behavior under content-check service outages.

### 2026-04-17 — APIM DLP Policy Variants: Opt-In Fail-Open Content-Check (Complete)

**Task:** Created 2 DLP-enabled APIM policy variants (`-dlp` suffix) for optional Purview DLP content-check enforcement. Customers without DLP requirements use base policies; customers with DLP use DLP-suffix variants.

**Files Created:**
- `policies/subscription-key-policy-dlp.xml` — Subscription key auth + DLP content-check
- `policies/entra-jwt-policy-dlp.xml` — Entra JWT auth + DLP content-check

**Files Unchanged:**
- `policies/subscription-key-policy.xml` — Base policy remains identical (precheck only)
- `policies/entra-jwt-policy.xml` — Base policy remains identical (precheck only)

**Content-Check Pipeline:**
1. **Placement:** After precheck succeeds (HTTP 200) + routing logic, before backend forwarding
2. **Request:** POST /api/content-check/{clientAppId}/{tenantId} with original requestBody
3. **Response Handling:**
   - HTTP 451 → Block request with Azure OpenAI-style content_filter error response
   - Any other status/failure → Proceed (fail-open)
4. **Timeout:** 10 seconds (matches precheck timeout)
5. **Authentication:** APIM managed identity token (consistent with precheck)

**Fail-Open Strategy:**
- Uses `ignore-error="true"` on send-request element
- Transient failures (timeouts, 500s, network issues) DON'T block valid requests
- Only explicit HTTP 451 response blocks requests
- Prioritizes availability: content-check outages don't create request failures

**Error Response Format (HTTP 451):**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Content blocked by policy",
    "type": "content_filter",
    "code": "content_blocked"
  }
}
```
Mimics Azure OpenAI content_filter format for client compatibility.

**Policy Selection Guide:**
| Customer Need | Policy |
|--------------|--------|
| Auth + quota only | Base (no `-dlp`) |
| Auth + quota + Purview DLP | DLP (`-dlp`) |

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Placement:** Content-check after routing ensures routed deployment is determined before DLP evaluation
- **Variable reuse:** Uses existing `requestBody`, `containerAppBaseUrl`, `msi-access-token`, `clientAppId`, `tenantId`
- **Response handling:** `contentCheckResponse` variable checked only for HTTP 451 status
- **Null safety:** `context.Variables.ContainsKey("contentCheckResponse")` guards all response access
- **XML encoding:** `&amp;&amp;` for `&&` in condition expressions (proper XML)

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing deployments using base policies unaffected
- DLP variants are opt-in — customers explicitly choose when needed
- No breaking changes to base policies

**Trade-offs:**
- 4 policies to maintain (base + DLP × 2 auth types)
- Future changes must be applied consistently across variants to prevent policy drift
- Fail-open trade-off: transient outages allow unfiltered content (by design for availability)

**Testing & Monitoring:**
- Both policies syntactically valid XML
- HTTP 451 handling verified for blocking requests
- Fail-open strategy confirmed for transient failures
- Error response format matches Azure OpenAI conventions
- Backward compatibility verified (base policies unchanged)

**Next steps:**
- Deploy DLP policies to APIM for customers requiring DLP enforcement
- Monitor HTTP 451 response rates for DLP policy effectiveness
- Track content-check endpoint latency and failure rates
- Document policy selection criteria in deployment guides
- Test fail-open behavior under content-check service outages
