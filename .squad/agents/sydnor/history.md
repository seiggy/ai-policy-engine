# Project Context

- **Owner:** Zack Way

- **Stack:** .NET 9 API (Chargeback.Api) with Aspire orchestration (Chargeback.AppHost), React frontend (chargeback-ui), Azure Managed Redis (caching), CosmosDB (long-term trace/audit storage), Azure API Management (policy enforcement), Bicep (infrastructure)
- **Created:** 2026-03-31

## Key Files

- `infra/` — Azure Bicep templates (my primary workspace)
- `policies/` — APIM policy definitions
- `src/Chargeback.AppHost/` — Aspire orchestration
- `src/Dockerfile` — Container build
- `scripts/` — Deployment and utility scripts

## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

### 2026-03-31 — Phase 0 Complete: Backend Storage Architecture Established

**Phase 0 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Freamon + Bunk)

The backend storage architecture has been refactored from Redis-only to a durable CosmosDB source-of-truth pattern with Redis as a write-through cache. Infrastructure implications:

**What Sydnor Needs to Know:**
- **New CosmosDB Container:** `configuration` container added to `ConfigurationContainerInitializer`. Stores plans, clients, pricing, usage policies, and future routing policies. Partitioned by `/id` (document ID).
- **Redis Remains Caching Layer:** All reads still go through Redis first. Write-through cache means writes hit Cosmos first, then Redis is updated.
- **Startup Services:** New services on startup: `RedisToCosmossMigrationService` (one-time migration of existing Redis data) and `CacheWarmingService` (populate Redis from Cosmos). Both are idempotent.
- **No New Azure Resources:** Existing Cosmos + Redis still sufficient. No changes to Bicep or Azure resource provisioning needed.
- **Container Initialization:** `ConfigurationContainerInitializer.cs` now creates `configuration` container with proper schema initialization.
- **Deployment Impact:** Minimal. Startup is slightly slower due to cache warming, but no downtime required. Redis data is automatically migrated on first startup.

**For Phase 1 Onwards:**
- Model Routing will add `routing-policies` to the `configuration` container.
- Multiplier Pricing will extend existing `pricing` and `plans` documents with new fields.
- All future configuration entities will use the same repository pattern + caching layer.

**Test Results:** 129/129 tests pass (36 new Phase 5 tests for repositories/migration/warmup).

### 2026-03-31 — Phase 1 Complete: Model Routing Architecture Ready for Phase 3

**Phase 1 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Freamon + Bunk)

All model routing and per-request multiplier pricing features are complete and tested. Backend API contracts finalized. Infrastructure requirements unchanged (uses existing CosmosDB + Redis).

**What Sydnor Needs to Know for Phase 3:**

- **Backend is Ready:** All 7 routing enforcement endpoints ready (F2.1–F2.7). No more breaking changes — API contracts stable.
- **Precheck Response Extended:** New fields available: `routedDeployment`, `requestedDeployment`, `routingPolicyId`. APIM policies can use these for access control decisions.
- **Rate Limiting by Deployment:** Rate limit checks now deployment-scoped. The routed deployment is the one that gets rate-limited, not the originally requested model.
- **Multiplier Billing Fields:** Audit trail includes pricing data: `Multiplier`, `EffectiveRequestCost`, `TierName`. APIM policies can log these for chargeback.
- **Deployment Discovery:** All routing evaluations validate against Foundry deployments. Empty Foundry = strict validation failure (no phantom references).
- **No New Azure Resources:** Phase 3 uses existing resources. APIM policies are stateless — they call precheck and log ingest endpoints.
- **Backward Compat:** All new fields are nullable. Existing clients continue to work without changes.

**Ready for Phase 3 Deployment:**
- Deploy Chargeback.Api with Phase 2 enforcement active
- Configure APIM policies to call precheck endpoint for authentication/authorization
- APIM policies log routing + pricing metadata via log ingest endpoint
- No schema migrations needed — CosmosDB containers already configured

**Test Results:** 200/200 tests pass (30 new Phase 2 integration tests from Bunk B5.7 + B5.8).

### 2026-03-31 — Phase 3 Complete: APIM Auto-Router Policies (S3.1–S3.3)

**Phase 3 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Sydnor)

Both APIM policy files updated with auto-router support. Identical routing logic in both policies.

**What Changed:**

- **Inbound — Auto-Router Logic (after precheck, before backend):**
  - Extracts `routedDeployment` from precheck 200 response using `Body.As<JObject>(preserveContent: true)`
  - If `routedDeployment` is non-empty AND differs from the client's `deploymentId`: saves original as `originalDeploymentId`, updates `deploymentId`, rewrites URL path via `<rewrite-uri>`
  - If `routedDeployment` is null/empty or matches requested deployment: no-op, existing behavior preserved
  - Comment block explains auto-router semantics: no forced downgrades, pass-through for explicit deployments

- **Outbound — Extended Log Payload:**
  - Added `requestedDeploymentId` (original client ask) and `routedDeployment` (precheck recommendation) to the fire-and-forget `/api/log` POST
  - `requestedDeploymentId` = `originalDeploymentId` if routing happened, else `deploymentId`
  - `routedDeployment` = precheck value or empty string

**Design Decisions:**
- `preserveContent: true` on response body read ensures the body stream isn't consumed before backend routing
- `&amp;&amp;` used in XML condition (proper XML entity encoding for `&&`)
- URL rewrite uses `path.Replace()` — safe no-op when URL doesn't contain `/deployments/{id}/` (e.g., Responses API body-based model)
- `originalDeploymentId` only set inside routing `<when>` block — log payload checks `ContainsKey` to handle both routed and non-routed paths

**Files Modified:**
- `policies/subscription-key-policy.xml` — +43 lines (S3.1 + S3.3)
- `policies/entra-jwt-policy.xml` — +43 lines (S3.2 + S3.3)

### 2026-03-31 — Session Complete: All 5 Phases Delivered

**Project Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

All work is done. Phase 3 (APIM auto-router policies) is complete, Phase 4 (Frontend) is complete, Phase 5 (testing + validation) is complete. 222 tests passing. Backend routing and multiplier pricing features fully operational. APIM policy layer ready for production deployment.

**Sydnor's Contributions:**
- Phase 3 (S3.1–S3.3): APIM auto-router policy implementation, request logging extended with routing metadata

**What's Ready for Deployment:**
- Backend API (Chargeback.Api) with all routing/pricing/enforcement endpoints
- APIM policies (subscription-key, entra-jwt) with auto-router logic
- Frontend UI (React) with adaptive billing dashboards and routing policy management
- CosmosDB configured with configuration containers
- 222 integration + unit tests, all passing
- Performance validated: routing sub-microsecond, precheck <5ms p99

**Next Phase (Future):**
- Policy engine for enforced model rewrites
- Health check integration for fallback routing
- Load-based routing for PTU optimization
