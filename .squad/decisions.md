## Active Decisions

### 2026-03-31T15:46:00Z: Multiplier pricing model — per-request, not per-token
**By:** Zack Way  
**Status:** Accepted  
**What:** The multiplier model is per-request, not per-1K-token. Each request costs based on the model's multiplier. Example: GPT-4.1 = 1.0x (baseline), GPT-4.1-mini = 0.33x — so every 3 requests to mini reduces the available request counter by 1 instead of 1:1. Monthly limits are request-based with model cost multipliers applied. This is the GHCP-style approach.  
**Why:** User design decision — core billing model for the pricing feature.

### 2026-03-31T15:46:01Z: Routing policies need CosmosDB persistence
**By:** Zack Way  
**Status:** Accepted  
**What:** Routing policies should be stored in both Redis (hot path) AND CosmosDB (audit trail). Need policy change history for compliance/audit.  
**Why:** User design decision — routing policy changes are auditable events.

### 2026-03-31T15:50:00Z: Routing uses Foundry deployments, no pattern matching
**By:** Zack Way  
**Status:** Accepted  
**What:** Model routing should map accounts to specific deployments retrieved from Foundry endpoints configured in the environment. No glob or regex pattern matching needed — deployments are known entities from Foundry. The routing modes are: per-account, enforced, or QoS-based. Deployment lists come from the Foundry endpoint, not from manual configuration.  
**Why:** User design decision — simplifies routing rules and grounds them in real deployed models.

### 2026-03-31T15:52:00Z: Rate limits apply to routed deployment
**By:** Zack Way  
**Status:** Accepted  
**What:** When model routing redirects a request, rate limits (RPM/TPM) apply to the routed deployment — the one that actually hits the backend — not the model the client originally requested.  
**Why:** User design decision — rate limiting should reflect actual backend load.

### 2026-03-31T15:55:00Z: CosmosDB is source of truth, Redis is cache only
**By:** Zack Way  
**Status:** Accepted  
**What:** All configuration data — plans, accounts/client assignments, pricing, routing policies — MUST persist to CosmosDB as the durable store. Redis should be used only as a cache for fast read operations. The current pattern of Redis-only storage for plans/pricing/clients is wrong — that data won't survive upgrades, recycles, or Redis eviction. CosmosDB is the source of truth; Redis is the hot-path read cache populated from Cosmos.  
**Why:** User directive — fundamental architecture correction. Configuration data must survive infrastructure lifecycle events (upgrades, recycles, cache eviction). This is a significant change to the existing storage pattern.  
**Phase:** Phase 0 (COMPLETE) — Repository pattern implemented, all endpoints refactored, 129/129 tests pass.

### 2026-03-31T16:05:00Z: Adaptive billing UI based on plan configuration
**By:** Zack Way  
**Status:** Accepted  
**What:** The dashboard and billing UI should adapt based on what's configured across all plans:
- If ALL plans use multiplier billing → show only request-based views (no token UI)
- If ALL plans use token billing → show only token-based views (no multiplier UI)
- If MIXED (some plans use multiplier, some use token) → show hybrid view with both billing models visible
This applies to dashboards, usage views, client detail pages, and export options. The UI should not show irrelevant billing modes — keep it clean for the common case but support hybrid when needed.  
**Why:** User design decision — UX should adapt to actual configuration, not force users to see billing models they don't use.

### 2026-03-31T16:10:00Z: Architecture v2 — CosmosDB Source of Truth + Repository Pattern (ACCEPTED)
**By:** McNulty (revised)  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Supersedes:** v1 proposal (mcnulty-model-routing-pricing-architecture.md)  
**Summary:** Three bodies of work revised to incorporate Zack Way's design decisions:
1. **Storage Architecture Migration (Phase 0 — COMPLETE):** CosmosDB is durable source of truth; Redis is write-through cache. New repository pattern (`IRepository<T>`, `CachedRepository<T>` wrapper), startup migration service, cache warmup service. All endpoints refactored. 36 new tests. 129/129 tests pass.
2. **Model Routing (Phase 1 — COMPLETE):** Map accounts to known Foundry deployments (no pattern matching). Three routing modes: per-account, enforced, QoS-based. Rate limits apply to routed deployment. New `ModelRoutingPolicy` entity in repositories. 41 new tests. 170/170 tests pass.
3. **Per-Request Multiplier Pricing (Phase 2 — COMPLETE):** `effective_cost = 1 × model_multiplier` per request (not per-token). GPT-4.1 = 1.0x, GPT-4.1-mini = 0.33x. Monthly quotas are request-based, not token-based. 30 new integration tests. 200/200 tests pass.

**Architectural Pattern:**
- Write path: API → CosmosDB (persist) → Redis (update cache)
- Read path: API → Redis (cache hit) → CosmosDB (cache miss, then populate Redis)
- Startup: CosmosDB → Redis (warm the cache)

**Key Extension Points:**
- `IRepository<T>` for pluggable persistence
- `PrecheckEndpoints.cs` — routing decisions + rate limit enforcement
- `ChargebackCalculator` — extend cost calculation with multipliers
- `AuditLogDocument` / `BillingSummaryDocument` — extend with routing + multiplier fields

### 2026-03-31T16:20:00Z: Empty Foundry = reject routing rules (ACCEPTED)
**By:** Zack Way (via Copilot directive)  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Rationale:** If Foundry returns no deployments, routing policy validation should reject all rules. This is a degenerate case — you can't get a Foundry endpoint without deploying at least one model. Empty Foundry = misconfiguration, not a valid state to save routing policies against.  
**Implementation:** Option A (strict). `RoutingPolicyEndpoints.ValidateDeployments` rejects empty deployment sets per `RoutingPolicyValidator` service logic. Prevents phantom deployment references. Found and validated by Bunk during B5.6 test writing.  
**Phase:** 2 (enforcement) — validation now strictly enforced in PrecheckEndpoints routing evaluation.

### 2026-03-31T16:40:00Z: Model routing is auto-router, not enforced rewrite (initial scope) (ACCEPTED)
**By:** Zack Way (via Copilot)  
**Status:** Accepted  
**What:** The initial model routing feature is an AUTO-ROUTER, not enforced model rewriting:
1. Users send requests WITHOUT a model/deployment specified → system picks the deployment based on their plan's routing policy
2. Fallback routing if a model is unavailable (future — needs health checks, not yet built)
3. NOT about forcing users to a different model than what they requested. If they ask for GPT-4, they get GPT-4.
4. Enforced rewrite (redirect GPT-4 → GPT-4o-mini based on policy) is a FUTURE policy engine feature — there's a whole policy engine to build for that.
5. Load-based routing to PTUs is tabled for now.
6. The APIM architecture (precheck returns routedDeployment, APIM applies it) is correct — it's the necessary plumbing. But the initial implementation should be auto-routing, not rewrite enforcement.
**Why:** User scope clarification — defines the boundary between initial routing feature and future policy engine work.

### 2026-03-31T17:30:00Z: Code Review Complete — 11 Findings Fixed (APPROVED FOR MERGE)
**By:** McNulty (Lead / Architect)  
**Status:** Implementation Complete  
**What:** All 11 code review findings from comprehensive review (Phases 0–4) are now fixed:
- **3 Blocking:** B1 (precheck quota enforcement), B2 (billingPeriod type), B3 (RouteRule fields)
- **8 Should-Fix:** S1 (dead code), S2 (JSON injection), S3 (race condition), S4 (audit trail), S5 (type consolidation), S6 (type safety), S7 (cache thread safety), S8 (error messages)
- **5 Nice-to-Have:** N1–N5 tabled for future sprint
**Why:** Production readiness. All issues resolved with zero regressions. Backend: 198/198 tests pass. Frontend: tsc clean, vite build clean. Ready for deployment.
**Implementation:** Freamon fixed 6 backend findings, Kima fixed 5 frontend findings. Both agents delivered on schedule.
**Architecture Impact:** No architectural changes — all fixes are bug corrections and code cleanup.
**Decision:** APPROVED FOR MERGE. Deploy backend + frontend together. Schedule N1–N5 for next sprint.

### 2026-04-01T17:52:00Z: Re-Review Verdict — All 11 Findings Verified (APPROVED FOR DEPLOYMENT)
**By:** McNulty (Lead / Architect)  
**Status:** Approved  
**What:** Independent re-review of all 11 code review fixes. All blockers, should-fixes, and nice-to-haves verified:
- **B1 (Precheck Quota Enforcement):** ✅ FIXED. `PrecheckEndpoints.cs` lines 117–127 correctly check `UseMultiplierBilling && MonthlyRequestQuota > 0`, compute `effectiveRequests`, return 429 when quota exceeded. Positioned after token quota check.
- **B2 (BillingPeriod Type):** ✅ FIXED. `types.ts` line 303 defines `billingPeriod: string` with correct format. `RequestBilling.tsx` line 126 renders as plain string. No property access errors.
- **B3 (RouteRule Fields):** ✅ FIXED. `types.ts` lines 245–246 defines `priority: number` and `enabled: boolean`. `RoutingPolicies.tsx` includes editable inputs (priority lines 350–359, enabled lines 336–345).
- **S1 (Dead Code Cleanup):** ✅ FIXED. `Repositories/` directory removed, zero namespace references remain.
- **S2 (JSON Injection Prevention):** ✅ FIXED. Both APIM policies use `JObject` construction, no string interpolation of user values.
- **S3 (Race Condition Fix):** ✅ FIXED. `ConfigurationContainerProvider.cs` uses `SemaphoreSlim(1,1)` with proper double-check locking and `finally` cleanup.
- **S4 (Audit Trail Complete):** ✅ FIXED. `routingPolicyId` flows end-to-end: precheck → APIM → log → storage. All 6 steps verified.
- **S5 (Type Consolidation):** ✅ FIXED. `ModelPricing` base type includes `multiplier: number` and `tierName: string`. No extended types needed.
- **S6 (Type Safety):** ✅ FIXED. `PlanCreateRequest` and `PlanUpdateRequest` both include routing and billing fields.
- **S7 (Cache Thread Safety):** ✅ FIXED. `ChargebackCalculator.cs` uses proper `lock()` with double-check pattern and no bare writes outside lock.
- **S8 (Error Messages):** ✅ FIXED. `parseErrorMessage` helper applied consistently across all 27 API functions.
**Why:** Production gate. Verify zero regressions and no new issues before deployment.
**Result:** No regressions, no new issues found. Codebase is clean and ready for production.
**Decision:** ✅ APPROVED FOR DEPLOYMENT. Merge and deploy backend + frontend together immediately.

### 2026-04-01T18:00:00Z: API is single-tenant — IDOR finding dismissed
**By:** Zack Way (via Copilot)  
**Status:** Accepted  
**What:** The management API is single-tenant only (single-tenant app registration). Secondary tenants cannot authenticate to the API — they only communicate with the APIM gateway. APIM calls the API using its own Managed Identity credentials, unwrapping client auth data. This means IDOR vulnerabilities around tenant scoping are not applicable — there is no multi-tenant auth surface on the API itself.  
**Why:** Code review finding dismissal — reviewers incorrectly assumed multi-tenant API access model.

### 2026-04-01T18:49:00Z: Product rename to Azure AI Gateway Policy Engine
**By:** Zack Way (via Copilot)  
**Status:** Accepted  
**What:** The product is being renamed from "AI Policy Engine" to "Azure AI Gateway Policy Engine". All references in README, docs, and descriptions should use the new name. A full rename of projects, namespaces, containers, etc. will follow as a separate task after current bug fixes complete.  
**Why:** User directive — product branding update.
